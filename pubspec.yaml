# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is

# ADDED: Top-level configuration for flutter_launcher_icons (This block was correctly added)
# This integrates the settings you had previously under the 'flutter' key
# and places them correctly as a top-level configuration block.
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: true # Assuming you want Android icons
  ios: true     # Assuming you want iOS icons
  image_path: "assets/icon/BetCrack.png" # Your main icon path
  adaptive_icon_background: "#000000"  # Your specified background
  # MODIFIED: Use your existing BetCrack.png for the adaptive foreground
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/icon/BetCrack.png" # Your specified foreground (NOW POINTING TO YOUR EXISTING ICON)
  # You can add other flutter_launcher_icons options here if needed, like:
  # min_sdk_android: 21
  # remove_alpha_ios: true

# REMOVED: Top-level configuration for flutter_native_splash
# flutter_native_splash:
#   color: "#00695C"
#   image: "assets/images/splash.jpg"
#   android_gravity: fill
#   ios_content_mode: scaleAspectFill
#   android_12:
#     image: "assets/images/splash.jpg"

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter: # Your original flutter block

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets: # Your original assets block, with icon paths added/modified if not already present
    # Make sure these paths are correct and the files exist in your project.
    - assets/icon/BetCrack.png # Path to your main app icon/logo
    - assets/images/splash.jpg # Your splash screen image (can keep if you might use it later in Flutter)

  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # Note: The lines you had here previously: (This comment block is from a previous iteration by me, kept for context of the change)
  #   - image_path: "assets/icon/BetCrack.png"
  #   adaptive_icon_background: "#000000"
  #   adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/icon/app_icon.png"
  # were part of the flutter_launcher_icons configuration but were misplaced.
  # They are now correctly under the top-level 'flutter_launcher_icons:' block.
  # The actual asset file paths need to be listed directly under 'assets:' like above.


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
